## Decision Model – Ticket Priority

This folder contains decision models used to determine the priority of
customer support tickets based on defined business conditions.

The primary artifact is a decision table that translates input criteria
(such as customer type, issue category, service impact, and SLA status)
into clear and consistent priority outcomes.

The decision model supports objective, repeatable decision-making and
reduces operational risk caused by subjective prioritization.
