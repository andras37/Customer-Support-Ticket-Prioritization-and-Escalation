# Customer Support Ticket Prioritization & Escalation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Business Analyst approach to designing and documenting
ticket prioritization and escalation logic within a customer support environment.

The focus is on **business rules analysis**, **decision logic**, and **operational risk handling**
to ensure that high-impact tickets are identified, prioritized, and escalated consistently.

The project is intentionally lightweight compared to Project 1 and 2, highlighting
clarity of thinking rather than documentation volume.

## Business Context
Customer support teams handle tickets with varying urgency, impact, and SLA risk.
Without clear prioritization and escalation rules, critical issues may be delayed,
leading to SLA breaches and customer dissatisfaction.

This project addresses:
- Inconsistent ticket prioritization
- Manual or unclear escalation decisions
- Operational risk caused by subjective handling

- Ticket prioritization criteria
