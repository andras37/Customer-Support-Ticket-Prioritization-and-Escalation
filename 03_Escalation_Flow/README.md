## Escalation Flow – Process Model

This folder contains the escalation process model illustrating how support
tickets are escalated based on priority level and operational risk.

The process focuses on:
- Priority-driven escalation triggers
- Clear role involvement (Support Agent, Team Lead, Manager)
- Structured handling of high-impact and critical tickets

The model supports consistent escalation decisions while avoiding unnecessary
management involvement for lower-priority cases.
