## Business Rules – Ticket Prioritization

This folder contains the business rules defining how support tickets are
prioritized and escalated based on business-relevant criteria.

The rules focus on:
- Objective ticket prioritization
- Consistent escalation decisions
- Reduction of operational risk caused by subjective handling

The documented rules translate business conditions (customer type, issue impact,
SLA risk) into clear, actionable priority outcomes that can be implemented
and maintained within a ticketing system.
